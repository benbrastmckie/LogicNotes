export USER_ARGS="Review the organizational structure of other modal logic sections (sec:FirstOrder, sec:TenseModality, etc.) to understand the standard pattern for presenting syntax, semantics, proof theory, and metalogic. Then create a plan to reorganize sec:Bimodal to follow this same structure, eliminating redundancy while preserving the task semantics content that was just added. The goal is to have one cohesive bimodal system divided into natural subsections for syntax, semantics, proof theory, and metalogic components."
