export USER_ARGS="I'm still not that happy with the bimodal sections in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Teaching/LogicNotes/LogicNotes.tex since the syntax is too belabored (we have already introduced the tense and modal operators in previous sections so very little is now required to introduce the bimodal language since we can draw of previous conventions), the semantics is also a little verbose (I want cleanly stated definitions with minimal or no discussion, and no examples or proofs, though problem sets are OK), and I want the tense logic axioms to be set up already in the previous sections on tense so that the bimodal axiom system can import these (simply stating that it is the minimal extension to include all instances of the S5 modal logic and the tense logic TL along with the two additional bimodal interaction principles). There should be no worked examples or proofs anywhere, focusing instead on a clean and austere presentation of these systems in a way that builds systematically on previous elements to avoid redundancy and to make the system maximally compact and concise. Create a plan to make these changes systematically."
