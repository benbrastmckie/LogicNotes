The tense logic in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Teaching/LogicNotes/LogicNotes.tex has TK as an axiom instead of as a rule (the rule has been renamed FN) even though the axiom version is derivable from the rule (include just the rule, calling it TK to match the setup in sec:Appendix in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Papers/PossibleWorlds/JPL/possible_worlds.tex. I want the LogicNotes.tex to follow possible_worlds.tex exactly, looking at the appendix for definitions. I also want to remove all proofs from the metalogic section of the bimodal theory in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Teaching/LogicNotes/LogicNotes.tex making these cases problems in the metalogic problem set instead. Remove the completeness section entirely. Create a plan to make these changes.
