  abstract =      {The Logic Manual is a clear and concise introduction
                   to logic for beginning philosophy students. It offers
                   a complete introductory course, guiding the reader
                   carefully through the topics in logic that are most
                   important for the study of philosophy. It covers
                   propositional and predicate logic with and without
                   identity. It includes an account of the semantics of
                   these languages including definitions of truth and
                   satisfaction. Natural deduction is used as a proof
                   system. Volker Halbach introduces the essential
                   concepts through examples and informal explanations
                   as well as through abstract definitions. The Logic
                   Manual provides the best entry to the general
                   abstract way of thinking about language, logic, and
                   semantics which is characteristic of contemporary
                   philosophy. Exercises, examples, and sample
                   examination papers are provided on an accompanying
                   website.},
