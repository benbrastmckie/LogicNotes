# Logic Notes

> Highly compressed notes for reference and teaching.

The aim is to present a number of logical systems in a uniform notation rather a full exposition of each system.
Details are provided for the proof theory and semantics for each system along with a statement of soundness and completeness.

The notes currently include:

- Classical Propositional Logic
- First-Order Logic
- Propositional Modal Logic

I will be expanding these notes to include the following additional systems for [24.711](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory) at MIT, Spring 2025:

- Quantified Modal Logic
- Tense Logic
- Bimodal Logic
- Counterfactual Logic
- Constitutive Logic

I also hope to extend consideration to some basic set theory and lattice theory in support of the final two logical systems.
