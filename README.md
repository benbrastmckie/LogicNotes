# Logic Notes

> Highly compressed notes in a uniform notation for reference and teaching a variety of logical systems.

These notes aim to present a number of logical systems in a uniform notation rather a full exposition of each system.
Although the [current version](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/LogicNotes/blob/main/LogicNotesCurrent.pdf) is under construction, the notes already include the following systems:

- Classical Propositional Logic
- First-Order Logic
- Propositional Modal Logic

I will be both rewriting these notes to conform to the conventions in the [ForAllX textbook](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ForAllX) as well as expanding consideration to the following systems for [24.711 "The Modern History of Modal Logic"](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory) at MIT, Spring 2025:

- Quantified Modal Logic
- Tense Logic
- Bimodal Logic
- Counterfactual Logic
- Constitutive Logic

The [ForAllX textbook](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ForAllX) provides a more systematic treatment of propositional and first-order logic.
You can also find some basic set theory presented in an accessible way [here](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/OpenLogic/tree/master/courses/sets-logic-computation).
