# Logic Notes

> Highly compressed notes for reference and teaching.

These notes aim to present a number of logical systems in a uniform notation rather a full exposition of each system.
Although the [current version](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/LogicNotes/blob/main/LogicNotesCurrent.pdf) is under construction, the notes include the following systems:

- Classical Propositional Logic
- First-Order Logic
- Propositional Modal Logic

I will be both rewriting these notes to conform to the conventions in the [ForAllX textbook](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ForAllX) as well as expanding consideration to the following systems for [24.711](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ModalHistory) at MIT, Spring 2025:

- Quantified Modal Logic
- Tense Logic
- Bimodal Logic
- Counterfactual Logic
- Constitutive Logic

If your math is rusty, [here](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/OpenLogic/tree/master/courses/sets-logic-computation) is an open source textbook with some of the basics presented in an accessible way.
